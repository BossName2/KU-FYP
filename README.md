# Dev blog

This blog will chronicle all my learning in my final year university project.

- 21/10/2023 learned to make a simple endpoint for my database using express.
- 23/10/2023 Had to re-envision my idea for my initial user story as I will have to re-write the endpoints that I have implemented as they don't make much sense as a starting point.
- 24/10/2023 I successfully merged my sprint one development branch into my main repository using a pull request. I should do further reading on the different merge types to understand their advantages better.
- 24/10/2023 Learnt how to bullet point with markdown syntax.
